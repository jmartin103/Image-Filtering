# Image-Filtering
A simple webpage for uploading and filtering images. The image is uploaded to a canvas, and then the user is given four filtering options: grayscale, red, rainbow, or American flag filter. The user can also reset the image to normal. All of the filtering is done in JavaScript, and uses the SimpleImage class from the Duke Learn to Program library.
